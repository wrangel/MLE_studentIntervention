In order to perform this task it thus needs linear separability of the instances (often obtained by applying the \"kernel trick\"). The distance of the instance vectors, that lie the closest to the hyperplane, is maximized. With that, SVM tries to ensure the generalization to unknown data sets.\n",

    "2) Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are a method for the automated classification of instances by iterating through a series of questions / decisions and thus narrowing down the possibilies from step to step. They are consisting of nodes (representing the features), edges (feature values), and leaves (label). Since every node eliminates at least half of the possibilities for the nodes further down the tree, it is pivotal to choose the features which \"split the data best\" sequentially. In order to detect those, one uses metrics like ID3 which measure the information gain / reduction of randomness / entropy loss for each decision. A significant feature allows for a large information gain, i.e. reducing the entropy w.r.t the label.\n",

    "Strengths: Easy to interpret / graphically interpretable. Can be extended to random forests by ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Prone to overfitting, especially with lots of features. We need to have a close eye on pruning the tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "3) Nearest Neighbor Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The k nearest neighbor algorithm is a non-parametric method used for classification. It takes into account the k nearest neighbors by averaging their labels (voting), and thus bases upon saving the full sample and reusing it for prediction over and over again. This method is opposed to parametric learner methods: Parametric learners learn from the training instances and upon completion save only the derived function of the data, not the data itself. Nearest Neighbors Classifier in contrast is an instance method and keeps the full training set. They are thus known as \"lazy learners\".\n",
